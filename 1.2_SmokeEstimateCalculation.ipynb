    "On researching about Fires (https://www.epa.gov/), I figured that there can be many factors that influence fires & smoke production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Size of the Fire (GISAcres):\n",
    "- Larger fires tend to produce more smoke.\n",
    "- You can consider using GISAcres as a proxy for the potential amount of smoke produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type of Vegetation Burned:\n",
    "- Different types of vegetation produce different amounts of smoke.\n",
    "- If you have data on the type of vegetation, it could be incorporated into your model; otherwise, you might assume an average.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fire Intensity:\n",
    "- Intense fires typically consume more biomass and can generate more smoke.\n",
    "- This information might not be directly available, but fire intensity might be inferred from GISAcres or from specific fire behavior models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Combustion Efficiency:\n",
    "- Smoldering fires tend to produce more smoke than flaming fires.\n",
    "- This is more difficult to estimate without detailed data, but assumptions can be made based on fire type or anecdotal evidence from fire reports.\n",
    "\n",
    "Weather Conditions:\n",
    "- Wind speed and direction can affect the dispersion and dilution of smoke.\n",
    "- Weather conditions at the time of each fire might be used to adjust the estimated smoke production.\n",
    "\n",
    "Distance to City (shortest_dist):\n",
    "- The further away a fire is, the more smoke will disperse and dilate before reaching the city.\n",
    "- A decay function could be applied to account for smoke dilution over distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the data in hand, I wanted to start with something simple.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Weighted Smoke Impact Estimation:\n",
    "    For each fire event, we consider two factors: the size of the fire (measured in GISAcres) and the proximity to Farmington, NM (measured by shortest_dist). The size of the fire is directly proportional to the smoke produced, while the distance from the city will be inversely proportional to the smoke impact experienced by the city.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Impact Decay with Distance:\n",
    "    As smoke travels, it disperses and dilutes, so the impact of a fire on air quality should diminish with distance. This can be represented by a decay function. For simplicity, we can use an inverse distance weighting (IDW), which assumes that the impact decreases inversely with distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Annual Aggregation Method:\n",
    "    Instead of summing the impacts which could overstate the impact for years with many fires, or using the maximum which could understate the cumulative impact of multiple fires, the average smoke impact over the year is chosen. This way, we can avoid the need to determine the exact overlap of smoke in time while still getting a sense of the overall yearly impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Formula:\n",
    "    We can define the smoke impact estimate for each fire as follows:\n",
    "    **Smoke Estimate per Fire = GISAcres\\shortest_dist^alpha**\n",
    "     Where α is the decay exponent determining how rapidly the smoke impact falls off with distance. For simplicity, we can start with α=1, which is a simple inverse relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Annual Smoke Impact:\n",
    "    The annual smoke impact for Farmington can then be calculated as:\n",
    "    **Annual Smoke Estimate=Average(Smoke Estimate per Fire)**\n",
    "\n",
    "For each year, we would compute this value for all fires within the specified distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the above methodology, we will compile annual smoke estimates. The average is chosen because it provides a sense of the overall exposure without disproportionately weighting either large numbers of smaller fires or a few large fires.\n"
