# Part 1 Common-analysis
## DATA512 Human Centered Data Science
## Goal
In recent times, the narrative of summer in the western United States has been increasingly dominated by wildfires, with plumes of smoke enveloping multiple states. Several factors are implicated in this development, including climate change, forestry management policies of the United States, and a heightened collective consciousness of such events. Irrespective of their origins, the consequences of these fires extend far and wide, affecting numerous facets of life. Studies are consistently highlighting the adverse effects of smoke on human health, tourism, property values, and the socioeconomic fabric at large.

The primary aim of this initiative is to scrutinize the repercussions of wildfire smoke on Farmington, New Mexico, with the objective of deriving actionable insights to guide diverse interested parties. Our preliminary step involves an examination of historical wildfire data to derive estimates of smoke penetration within the city's confines. Subsequently, leveraging these findings, we aim to forecast the likely smoke patterns for the forthcoming quarter-century.

## Intermediate outputs
All of these files can be found under /intermediate folder. These are placed there because this is just part 1 of a project that will have a clearer deliverable.
1. [distance.csv](https://github.com/adithyaav27/data-512-common-analysis/blob/main/intermediate/distance.csv) - Produced by code 1.1, this has been generated by measuring the proximity of each fire within the composite USGS wildland fire dataset to Farmington, NM. It comprises two fields:
- OBJECTID, which denotes the unique identifier of the respective fire incident.
- shortest_dist, which indicates the minimum span separating the periphery of the fire from Farmington.

2. [closefires.csv](https://github.com/adithyaav27/data-512-common-analysis/blob/main/intermediate/closefires.csv) - Produced by code 1.1, this possesses identical categories to the previously mentioned one, however, it exclusively encompasses fire incidents that are situated within a 1250-mile radius of Farmington.

3. [features.csv](https://github.com/adithyaav27/data-512-common-analysis/blob/main/intermediate/features.csv) - Produced by code 1.1, this document extracts pertinent data regarding fire incidents post-1963 from the combined wildfire database maintained by the USGS, intended for subsequent utilization in generating smoke predictions. The dataset is structured with specific columns that include:
-  OBJECTID: A unique identifier for each fire event.
-  FireType: The category of the fire event recorded, with classifications such as wildfire, likely wildfire, uncertain but likely wildfire, prescribed fire, and uncertain but likely prescribed fire.
-  FireYear: The calendar year in which the fire occurred.
-  GISAcres: The measured area of the fire's geographic footprint, calculated via the Calculate Geometry function in ArcGIS Pro.
-  OverlapFlags: A designation for regions where there has been a recurrence of burning, exceeding 10% overlap of the original fire's area, within a one- or two-year timespan, as analyzed by the ArcGIS Tabulate Intersection Tool.

4. [finalfiresdata.csv](https://github.com/adithyaav27/data-512-common-analysis/blob/main/intermediate/finalfiresdata.csv): Produced by code 1.1, this document consolidates information regarding distances and characteristics to isolate specific data on fires that are situated within a 1250-mile radius of Farmington and transpired after 1963, including and beyond that year. The data fields included are:
-  OBJECTID: This is the unique identifier of each recorded fire event.
-  FireType: The category of the fire event recorded, with classifications such as wildfire, likely wildfire, uncertain but likely wildfire, prescribed fire, and uncertain but likely prescribed fire.

A reading of 0 signifies either an absence of smoke or a non-applicable measurement. The data is organized in two main columns:
- FireYear: Specifies the year of the fires.
- SmokeEstimate: Represents the average annual smoke calculations derived from periodic estimates throughout the corresponding year.
  
6. [daily_aqi.csv](https://github.com/adithyaav27/data-512-common-analysis/blob/main/intermediate/daily_aqi.csv): Produced within code 1.3, this is the raw data that is obtained from the API.

7. [yearly_aqi.csv](https://github.com/adithyaav27/data-512-common-analysis/blob/main/intermediate/yearly_aqi.csv): Produced within code 1.3, this file includes consolidated annual average Air Quality Index (AQI) data from all monitoring devices throughout San Juan County. The data is structured into 2 columns:
- year: Holds the specific twelve-month period in which AQI readings were gathered.
- yearly_avg_aqi: The mean AQI level calculated from all detectors in the county.

# Known Data Issues and Special Considerations
- The dataset from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) contains approximately 130,000 records of wildfires, with about 94,774 of these incidents taking place since 1963 and occurring within a 1,250-mile radius of Farmington, New Mexico.
- The USGS Wildland Fire Combined Dataset includes approximations of fire perimeters, with data pre-1980 likely underreporting fire occurrences.
- Fire boundaries are considered estimates, with the potential for numerous recording errors or omissions.
- The USGS dataset assumes land burns once per year; areas reported as burned more than once are counted as a single event.
- Fires in the dataset are classified as wild or prescribed based on the best available information, with some remaining uncertainties.
- A unified set of fields was created to standardize data from multiple sources, despite potential inconsistencies.
- Fire attributes in the dataset include a count of how often each entry appears to indicate data confidence levels.
- Data collection for the USGS dataset concluded in 2020.
- The fire distance calculation tool is limited to "ring" shaped fires; 36 "curve ring" shaped fires are incompatible and thus omitted.
- Air Quality Index (AQI) records from earlier periods can be intermittent. It has been observed that consistent and dependable AQI measurements from stations in Farmington, NM, commenced from 2005 onwards.
- AQI data is also restricted to the fire season for comparison with smoke estimates.
