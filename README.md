# Health Impacts of Wildfire Smoke in Farmington, NM
## DATA512 Human Centered Data Science
## Goal
In recent times, the narrative of summer in the western United States has been increasingly dominated by wildfires, with plumes of smoke enveloping multiple states. Several factors are implicated in this development, including climate change, forestry management policies of the United States, and a heightened collective consciousness of such events. Irrespective of their origins, the consequences of these fires extend far and wide, affecting numerous facets of life. Studies are consistently highlighting the adverse effects of smoke on human health, tourism, property values, and the socioeconomic fabric at large.

The primary aim of this initiative is to scrutinize the health impacts of wildfire smoke on Farmington, New Mexico, with the objective of deriving actionable insights to guide diverse interested parties. Our preliminary step involves an examination of historical wildfire data to derive estimates of smoke penetration within the city's confines. Subsequently, leveraging these findings, we aim to forecast the likely smoke patterns for the forthcoming quarter-century. We then analyse how the health factors are impacted my the smoke.

## Inputs
- USGS_Wildland_Fire_Combined_Dataset.json: This dataset from the US Geological Survey (USGS) offers a detailed record of wildfire occurrences in the United States since 1963. It includes wildfire polygons and associated metadata, essential for analyzing and predicting smoke impact on Farmington. Utilizing historical fire data and ARIMA modeling, we aim to assess smoke impact metrics crucial for forecasting future air quality trends in Farmington. The dataset, a consolidation of 40 wildland fire datasets, focuses on fires within a 1250-mile radius of Farmington post-1963. It is freely redistributable, requiring only proper metadata and source acknowledgment to the USGS.

- Air Quality Index: This dataset, accessed via an API from the EPA's Air Quality System database, contains historical and present Air Quality Index (AQI) measurements across the U.S. The AQI, ranging from 0 to 500, covers ground-level ozone, particle pollution, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide levels. Focusing on AQI readings from San Juan County during fire seasons, this dataset is pivotal for correlating smoke estimates with actual air quality and potential health impacts. Usage guidelines and terms are available on the dataset's website listed above.

-  Fertility Data: Fertility data from the [U.S. Census Bureau's website](https://data.census.gov/table/ACSST1Y2022.S1301), specifically the American Community Survey (ACS), offers valuable insights into the potential health impacts of smoke exposure on maternal health and birth outcomes. Covering Farmington, NM from 2010 to 2021, this dataset provides detailed demographic information, including fertility rates. This data was downloaded manually. You can go to the website, filter for the City and select the year. Hit the download option to download the file. Each year has its own Excel file which we can extract. Data is available in this repository under /FOLDER. Key columns: Label (Name of the parameter), Estimate (Fertility Rate %).
  
- Mortality & Medicare Enrollees Data: This comprehensive dataset from the [Dartmouth Atlas Data Website](https://data.dartmouthatlas.org/mortality/#by-year) includes both Mortality Data and Medicare Enrollees Data, crucial for assessing healthcare impacts in Farmington related to smoke exposure. The Mortality Data, spanning from 1999 to 2019, provides detailed insights into death rates in Farmington, enabling an understanding of the health challenges and severity of smoke events. Meanwhile, the Medicare Enrollees Data for the same period offers a clear picture of the elderly population in Farmington. This is vital for evaluating the healthcare systemâ€™s capacity, especially during smoke events when elderly individuals are more susceptible to health effects. Every year has an excel file for all cities. We filter using a python program. Data is available in this repository under /FOLDER. Key columns: HSA Name (City name), Medicare Enrollees, Total Moratality Rate (%).

# Known Data Issues and Special Considerations
- The dataset from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) contains approximately 130,000 records of wildfires, with about 94,774 of these incidents taking place since 1963 and occurring within a 1,250-mile radius of Farmington, New Mexico.
- The USGS Wildland Fire Combined Dataset includes approximations of fire perimeters, with data pre-1980 likely underreporting fire occurrences.
- Fire boundaries are considered estimates, with the potential for numerous recording errors or omissions.
- The USGS dataset assumes land burns once per year; areas reported as burned more than once are counted as a single event.
- Fires in the dataset are classified as wild or prescribed based on the best available information, with some remaining uncertainties.
- A unified set of fields was created to standardize data from multiple sources, despite potential inconsistencies.
- Fire attributes in the dataset include a count of how often each entry appears to indicate data confidence levels.
- Data collection for the USGS dataset concluded in 2020.
- The fire distance calculation tool is limited to "ring" shaped fires; 36 "curve ring" shaped fires are incompatible and thus omitted.
- Air Quality Index (AQI) records from earlier periods can be intermittent. It has been observed that consistent and dependable AQI measurements from stations in Farmington, NM, commenced from 2005 onwards.
- AQI data is also restricted to the fire season for comparison with smoke estimates.
- The Fertility Rate data from the US Census might not of sampling errors. Especially during the 2020 COVID Pandemic.
- The Medicare Enrollees & Mortality data might have some sampling errors with a potential of bias.
