# Health Impacts of Wildfire Smoke in Farmington, NM
## DATA512 Human-Centered Data Science
## Goal
In recent times, the narrative of summer in the western United States has been increasingly dominated by wildfires, with plumes of smoke enveloping multiple states. Several factors are implicated in this development, including climate change, forestry management policies of the United States, and a heightened collective consciousness of such events. Irrespective of their origins, the consequences of these fires extend far and wide, affecting numerous facets of life. Studies are consistently highlighting the adverse effects of smoke on human health, tourism, property values, and the socioeconomic fabric at large.

The primary aim of this initiative is to scrutinize the health impacts of wildfire smoke in Farmington, New Mexico, with the objective of deriving actionable insights to guide diverse interested parties. Our preliminary step involves an examination of historical wildfire data to derive estimates of smoke penetration within the city's confines. Subsequently, leveraging these findings, we aim to forecast the likely smoke patterns for the forthcoming quarter-century. We then analyze how the health factors are impacted by the smoke. We will specifically answer three questions:
- What are the key health factors impacted?
- Is there an immediate impact or is it time-lagged?
- What are the future impact trends?

- Air Quality Index: This dataset, accessed via an API from the [EPA's Air Quality System database](https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html), contains historical and present Air Quality Index (AQI) measurements across the U.S. The AQI, ranging from 0 to 500, covers ground-level ozone, particle pollution, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen dioxide levels. Focusing on AQI readings from San Juan County during fire seasons, this dataset is pivotal for correlating smoke estimates with actual air quality and potential health impacts. Usage guidelines and terms are available on the dataset's website listed above.

## Known Data Issues and Special Considerations
- The dataset from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) contains approximately 130,000 records of wildfires, with about 94,774 of these incidents taking place since 1963 and occurring within a 1,250-mile radius of Farmington, New Mexico.
- The USGS Wildland Fire Combined Dataset includes approximations of fire perimeters, with data pre-1980 likely underreporting fire occurrences.
- Fire boundaries are considered estimates, with the potential for numerous recording errors or omissions.
- The USGS dataset assumes land burns once per year; areas reported as burned more than once are counted as a single event.
- Fires in the dataset are classified as wild or prescribed based on the best available information, with some remaining uncertainties.
- A unified set of fields was created to standardize data from multiple sources, despite potential inconsistencies.
- Fire attributes in the dataset include a count of how often each entry appears to indicate data confidence levels.
- Data collection for the USGS dataset concluded in 2020.
- The fire distance calculation tool is limited to "ring" shaped fires; 36 "curve ring" shaped fires are incompatible and thus omitted.
- Air Quality Index (AQI) records from earlier periods can be intermittent. It has been observed that consistent and dependable AQI measurements from stations in Farmington, NM, commenced from 2005 onwards.
- AQI data is also restricted to the fire season for comparison with smoke estimates.
- The Fertility Rate data from the US Census, Mortality and Medicare Enrollees data from Dartmouth Atlas has limited time coverage.
- All the health related data might have some sampling errors, especially during the 2020 COVID Pandemic, with a potential of bias.

## Conclusion
- The data shows that from 1963 to 2020, a considerable amount of forest fires occurred within a 1250-mile radius of Farmington, New Mexico. During this period, there was a variable yet overall upward trend in the amount of land affected by these fires. This led to the forecast of smoke patterns for the upcoming 25 years, which will assist in shaping the city's strategies to reduce the impact of future wildfires.
- The Smoke Forecast for 2021 to 2045 predicts extensive smoke penetration and its far-reaching effects in the coming years. This highlights the importance of investigating the specific health consequences of smoke exposure.
  
In summary, from the three impact analyses conducted:
- Health Parameter Affected - Correlation Analysis: We found a strong positive correlation between smoke estimates and mortality rates, suggesting that higher smoke exposure might lead to increased mortality rates. Conversely, a significant negative correlation between smoke estimates and fertility rates indicates that increased smoke exposure could be linked to lower fertility rates.
- Immediate vs Time-Lagged Effects - Lag Analysis: The strongest impact of smoke on health indicators is observed immediately (lag 0), indicating that the effects of smoke exposure are more pronounced in the short term.
- Future Impact Trends - Regression Analysis: The regression models show a strong and statistically significant relationship between higher smoke estimates and increased mortality rates. In contrast, a moderately negative, yet significant, relationship is observed between smoke estimates and fertility rates, suggesting that increased smoke exposure may negatively impact fertility. This gives us an idea about the future trends of the impact.
  
The analysis strongly indicates that smoke exposure in Farmington, NM, significantly affects health, necessitating immediate public health interventions. This situation underscores the urgency of incorporating smoke impact data into health and community planning. There's a pressing need for long-term strategies to reduce smoke exposure, particularly for vulnerable groups. Furthermore, the findings highlight the criticality of ongoing research to understand the relationship between smoke exposure and health outcomes better, ensuring future policies are informed and effective.
